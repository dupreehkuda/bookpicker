# Clubvent
clubvent is a telegram bot for picking random subject from club members'
suggestions for a club event

For example, you have a book club or a movie club and picking subject, 
in this case a book or a movie, starts being problematic as more people
join the club or have completely different tastes.

So this bot kinda solves the problem. It can create event, accept all 
subject suggestions, and choose one randomly. 
(In future releases: creating polls)

### Why use this bot instead of web randomizer?  
1. Well, maybe u would like to have some sort of statistics of your club: 
   - who suggest more
   - how many events u had
   - average time between events
   - etc  

2. A ton of work. Maybe u're fed up with asking members, numerating responses,
using random websites. Let your events be driven by members.

3. IDK ;) I just wanted to solve my problem and learn Rust, but I'll be 
grateful if u consider using it!
